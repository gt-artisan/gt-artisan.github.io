# AI4Science

We build AI systems that assist scientists in designing, running, and interpreting computational experiments.

## What we build
- Scientific assistants that generate domain inputs and workflows
- Benchmarking pipelines for scientific tasks
- Tools for structured knowledge compilation and experiment automation

## Current directions
- Chemistry-focused input generators (e.g., Psi4-style workflow assistants)
- AI methods that integrate with real CI stacks (HPC, cloud, edge)
- Human-in-the-loop interfaces for reliability and adoption
